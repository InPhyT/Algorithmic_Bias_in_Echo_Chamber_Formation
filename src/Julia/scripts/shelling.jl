###### SHELLING MODEL #######
#############################

"""
To set up an ABM simulation in Agents.jl, a user only needs to follow these steps:

1. Choose in what kind of space the agents will live in, for example a graph, a grid, etc. Several spaces are provided by Agents.jl and can be initialized immediately.
2. Define the agent type (or types, for mixed models) that will populate the ABM. This is defined as a standard Julia mutable struct that is a subtype of AbstractAgent. The type must contain two mandatory fields id, pos, with the position field being appropriate for the chosen space. The remaining fields of the agent type are up to user's choice.
3. The created agent type, the chosen space, and optional additional model level properties (typically in the form of a dictionary) are given to our universal structure AgentBasedModel. This instance defines the model within an Agents.jl simulation. Further options are also available, regarding schedulers and random number generation.
4. Provide functions that govern the time evolution of the ABM. A user can provide an agent-stepping function, that acts on each agent one by one, and/or model-stepping function, that steps the entire model as a whole. These functions are standard Julia functions that take advantage of the Agents.jl API. Once these functions are created, they are simply passed to step! to evolve the model.
5. [Optional] Visualize the model and animate its time evolution. This can help checking that the model behaves as expected and there aren't any mistakes, or can be used in making figures for a paper/presentation.
6. Collect data. To do this, specify which data should be collected, by providing one standard Julia Vector of data-to-collect for agents, for example [:mood, :wealth], and another one for the model. The agent data names are given as the keyword adata and the model as keyword mdata to the function run!. This function outputs collected data in the form of a DataFrame.
